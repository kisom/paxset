paxset
======

This a tool written to assist in maintaining a grsec system on Debian
testing[1]. The paxrat[2] and paxd[3] utilities were found to be unusable:
paxd wouldn't work at all (it needed to be run as root, and it wasn't
set up by default to do this), and paxrat left my system in an unusable
state. These tools probably work for other people, and I'm grateful
to have those programs as examples and inspiration. Your mileage will
likely vary.

I wrote this to fulfill a few goals:

	1. Flags were applied consistently to a set of programs on
	   system start.
	2. Flags would be applied even after a program was upgraded.
	3. The configuration file could be updated and the daemon would
	   reload the config file.
	4. The configuration file could be written in a sane manner.
	5. Use the existing paxctl(1) program to handle the mechanics
	   of actually setting flags on a program.

I chose to write a new utility because this is a simple enough task to do
the way I thought it should be done; I might have been able to patch
the others to fix them, but this lets do this my way (and avoid JSON!)
Note that paxset uses inotify(7) to watch the files listed in the config
and the config file itself, and cheats by shelling out to paxctl(1). If
the config file changes, it will be reloaded and the flags immediately
applied.

Configuration
-------------

paxset looks for the file /etc/paxset.conf, which follows the following
dumb grammar (noting that all lines are trimmed of leading and trailing
whitespace):

	+ empty lines are skipped
	+ lines beginning with '#' are skipped
	+ a flag set is specified by "path\tflags" (yes, this is a tab
	  separated file)

The file "paxset.conf.example" is provided as an example.


Installation
------------

Copy the example paxset.conf.example to paxset.conf and edit it
appropriately. Run "make" to build the program (or just run go build). Run
"make install" as root to copy the files over and install the systemd
service.


Standalone mode
---------------

This can be run without systemd: run "go build" or "make" to build the "paxset"
binary, then run "paxset -c /path/to/config" to do apply the flags in one shot,
or "paxset -c /path/to/config -w" to run a foreground inotify(7) watcher. If
the config file is in the default /etc/paxset.conf location, the "-c" flag and
argument may be omitted.
